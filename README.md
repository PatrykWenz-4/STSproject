# STSproject

This project is a setup of university tasks, that were implementing SpringBoot and with it:
- REST methods
- Regexp
- communication with databases
- SOAP
- Generating WSDL
- Mail communication
- Setting up SWAGGER UI
- using endpoints with Postman
- Oath 2 authorization

# State of the app

As some of the progress of the project was lost due to not implementing source control current version has following issues:
- Mails are not sending
- SOAP problems

# basic start
In order to start the database do:

docker start mysql-container

docker ps

docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -u root -p
